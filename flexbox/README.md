### Holy Grail Layout
The [Holy Grail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_grail_(web_design)) is a commonly desired webpage layout that has multiple, equal height columns defined in style sheets.  For years, the ways in which it could be implemented all came with drawbacks; however, flexbox resolves this issue.  This layout utilizes flexbox properties: flex-direction, justify-content, align-items, flex-basis, and flex-grow.
